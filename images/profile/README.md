# Profile Image Instructions

To add Mamello's profile picture:

1. Save the provided professional photo as `mamello-profile.jpg` in the `/images/profile/` folder
2. The image should be:
   - High quality (at least 600x600 pixels)
   - Professional headshot
   - JPG or PNG format
   - Optimized for web (under 500KB if possible)

The website is already configured to use:
- `/images/profile/mamello-profile.jpg` for the main profile image
- The image will be automatically resized and styled by the CSS

Alternative: You can also update the image path in index.html if you prefer a different filename.
